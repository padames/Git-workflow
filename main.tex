\section{Glossary}

For this tutorial, the following definitions will apply.

\begin{itemize}
    \item branch: a linked list of git commits where each commit is a node with parent(s) and children nodes.
    \item source: when applied to a branch refers to the name of another branch where the current one was grown from.
    \item remote: a repository affected by the pull and push commands 
    \item commit: a version of a file that can be computed as a delta or binary difference against a previous existing one.
    \item rebase: a git action and a concept whereby a series of commits from one branch is inserted into the same or another branch
    \item fast-forward: when a series of commits from a branch can be inserted, without any changes, at the tip of another branch because there are no conflicting commits.
    \item conflicting commit: when two or more commits affect the same parts of a file in ways that overlap each other.  
    \item merge: copying commits from one branch onto another starting at a specific commit
    \item local tree: the repository residing on the file system of the machine you are working in, as opposed to those that reside on a different machine or URL.
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature branch workflow}

The life cycle of a feature branch is to be created from its tree, receive new commits, be merged back into its tree and finally be deleted.
The quality of the history reflected by the tree will depend on how easy it is to interpret the tree.
In general the more linear the easier to understand as a timeline where file changes have happened at distinct points in time by specific contributors.

The workflow can be visualized through Figure~\ref{fig:feature-happy-path}. 
During the simultaneous growth of the branch and the main tree, there is potential for conflicts if the contributions made at the same location in the same file are different, technically the branch and the main tree have diverged.


\begin{figure}[hb!]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,trim={0cm 15cm 0 8cm},clip]{images/featurebranch_happy_path.png}
    \caption{Graphical representation of the history of a working tree when a feature branch is created. (a) The tree grows linearly, (b) the branch starts to grow, (c) both the branch and the main stem of the tree grow, (d) a copy of the branch is merged into the main stem, and (e) the branch is removed.}
    \label{fig:feature-happy-path}
\end{figure}

Let's look at the best practices while using feature branches.
The workflow calls for two main git strategies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item rebasing the source tree onto the feature branch as often as new commits appear on the source tree to address diverging histories.
    \item merging the feature branch into the source tree when the work is completed.
\end{itemize}

The first item, re-basing the source into the feature addresses potential conflicts created by the diverging timelines.

\section{Keeping the source branch up to date}

The ultimate goal of working with branches is to isolate change while work continues on the feature and origin branches.
When the origin branch in the local repository tracks a branch in an upstream remote, changes in the remote branch must be pulled and re-based over the local branch.
When this process is followed, all conflicts are solved as they appear, and the final merge into the remote will look linear and will be a simple fast-forward merge without conflicts.

In this scenario, the local repository has a branch called \textit{dev} that tracks a branch called the same name in the remote repository in a branch called \textit{origin}/\textit{dev}.
There is also a feature branch called \textit{feature} tracking \textit{origin}/\textit{feature}.

When there are new commits in \textit{origin}/\textit{dev} they should be brought into the local \textit{dev} branch via the following operation at the command line:

\begin{verbatim}
    (dev)$ git pull --rebase origin dev 
\end{verbatim}


In the above snippet, the \verb|(dev)$| indicates the current local branch name, in parenthesis, and the dollar symbol is the command line prompt.


\section{Comparing rebase and merge}
\label{sec:rebaseVsmeerge}


Figure~\ref{fig:initial-tree} shows the state of the tree in the remote before any operation on the branch \texttt{hello}.

\begin{figure}[hb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Tree_before_any_op.png}
    \caption{The tree shape in the remote and local before any operation on the branch home.}
    \label{fig:initial-tree}
\end{figure}

Two different strategies will be compared by applying them to this same initial tree.
Both operations start while the branch \texttt{hello} is checked out. 
After a \texttt{git rebase main} the local tree appears as in Figure~\ref{fig:tree-after-rebase}. 


\begin{figure}[hb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Tree_after_rebase_main_on_hello.png}
    \caption{The shape of the tree in the local repo after doing a rebase of \texttt{hello} with \texttt{main}.}
    \label{fig:tree-after-rebase}
\end{figure}

By contrast, Figure~\ref{fig:tree-after-merge} shows the same repo but after doing a merge of \texttt{main} on \texttt{hello}.


\begin{figure}[hb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Tree_after_merge_main_on_hello.png}
    \caption{The shape of the tree in the local repo after doing a merge of \texttt{hello} with \texttt{main}.}
    \label{fig:tree-after-merge}
\end{figure}

One of the most salient features is that rebase writes new commits when it enters a copy of the branch \texttt{hello} onto the branch \texttt{main} while it leaves the original commits untouched.

Confirm that the branch \texttt{hello} still shows the commits \textcolor{brown}{20ade47}, \textcolor{brown}{8807795}, and \textcolor{brown}{faa16f7} in both the rebase in Figure~\ref{fig:tree-after-rebase} and the merge trees \ref{fig:tree-after-merge}.
Both are highlighted with a yellow box of solid lines while the commits are marked by a red box along their final position, in the case of the rebase strategy they are still on the feature branch, while after the merge, they are part of the history of the \texttt{main} branch.

In the case of the rebase strategy, there are three new commits \textcolor{brown}{a3bb900}, \textcolor{brown}{db29e51}, \textcolor{brown}{b3ba61e} on \texttt{main} highlighted in red dash lines along the tree and in the new commit hashes are surrounded by a dash yellow box in  Figure~\ref{fig:tree-after-rebase}. Those commits are not present in the tree after the merge. 

If work in the branch \texttt{hello} ended at this point, deleting the branch pointers would make the commits disappear from the repo in the case of the rebase strategy. 
However, in the merge scenario, the branch pointer would be eliminated but the commits would stay in the tree.




% A feature branch \textit{feature} created from a \textit{dev} branch has to be re-based periodically with the purpose of minimizing and simplifying the conflicts later on if they occur while merging it into \textit{dev}.
% The result will be a linear tree that is simple to read.
